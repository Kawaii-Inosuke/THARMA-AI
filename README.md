# Tharma AI - Ethics of AI in E-Governance

## 📋 About
Tharma AI (Trustworthy, Accountable, Responsible Machine AI) is a two-year ICSSR longitudinal study examining trust, fairness, and accountability in AI-enabled e-governance systems across diverse Indian regions.
Duration: 2 Years (2025-2027)
Funding: Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR)
Lead Institution: SRM Institute of Science & Technology, Chennai

## 🎯 Project Overview
As India accelerates digital transformation through the Digital India initiative, AI is increasingly deployed in public services—from biometric welfare systems and healthcare triage to predictive policing and smart city surveillance. This study bridges the gap between technical innovation and social impact by examining how AI ethics evolve in real-world governance contexts.
